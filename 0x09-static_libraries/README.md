# Files.
* libmy.a
* main.h
* create_static_lib.sh

## Tasks.
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life - static library containing a list of functions.
1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future - this creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
