# Tasks
0. 0 _putchar -a program that prints _putchar
1. 1 I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game -a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase
2. 2 10 x alphabet - a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
3. 3 islower -a function that checks for lowercase character
4. 4 isalpha  -a function that checks for alphabetic character
5. 5 Sign -a function that prints the sign of a number.
6. 6 There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you -a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
7. 7 There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important -a function that prints the last digit of a number.
8. 8 I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life -a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
9. 9 Learn your times table -a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
10. 10 a + b -a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. 11 98 Battery Street, the OG -a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98
12. 12 The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself -a function that prints the n times table
13. 13 Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women - Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
14. 14 In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A -a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2

15. 15 Even Liber Abbaci -write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms
